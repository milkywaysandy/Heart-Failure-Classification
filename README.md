# Heart-Failure-Classification
A classification machine learning project on predicting death event amount heart failure patients.

**Project Background**
Heart Failure is a very common event causes by the cardiovascular disease (CVDs). CVDs is one of the most important topic in medicine, which estimated to take away 17.9 million lives each year worldwide. Thus, building a high precision and accuracy machine learning model for early detection is in need. This real-world clinical dataset included high cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and others, which would give great insights and possible application for early detection and future prevention as a goal. 

**Dataset Information & Quick Result Recap**
This dataset is based on the records of heart failure patients who had death event as an outcome during the follow up period between 4 to 284 days. Dataset were collected from the medical records of 299 heart failure patients at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan), during April to December 2015. Dataset came in tabulated format with 299 records, 12 features, and 1 target column. I uilterized six different supervised machine learning models, such as random forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Ada Boosting, Support Vector Machine, KNN, and Cat boosting, designed for classification task to identify the death event from the records. The best performing model is Random Forest classification with accuracy of 0.875.
